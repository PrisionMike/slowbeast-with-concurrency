Slowbeast

Slowbeast is a framework and python package for static analysis
of computer programs. The main focus is on symbolic execution algorithms
and invariant generation.

The goal of this project is to provide an environment for fast prototyping
of new algorithms based on symbolic execution. Apart from symbolic execution,
you can find (sometimes partial) implementations of other types of analyses like
abstract interpretation.
